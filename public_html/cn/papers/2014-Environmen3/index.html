The objectives of this study were to identify molecular features characteristic to arctic DOM from the Kolyma River basin and to elucidate structural imprints induced by a choice of the sorption technique. To achieve this goal, DOM was isolated from the Kolyma River basin with a use of three non-ionic sorbents -  Amberlite XAD-8 resin, PPL- and C18 - SPE cartridges, and one anion exchanging resin – diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) -cellulose. The structural studies were conducted with a use of electrospray ionization Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance (ESI FT-ICR) mass spectrometry and liquid state 1H NMR spectroscopy. The DOM isolates obtained with a use of PPL and C18 cartridges were characterized with higher content of aliphatic compounds as compared to XAD-8 and DEAE-isolates. In total, for all arctic DOM isolates we observed predominance of hydrogen saturated compounds with high H/C values of identified formulas from FT-ICR MS data. 1H NMR spectroscopy studies have confirmed this trend and revealed high contribution of alkyl-chain protons into the spectral density of the arctic DOM reaching 43\% for PPL isolates.
