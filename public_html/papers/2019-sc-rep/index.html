Humic substances (HS) are complex natural mixtures comprising a large variety of compounds produced
during decomposition of decaying biomass. the molecular composition of HS is extremely diverse as
it was demonstrated with the use of high resolution mass spectrometry. the building blocks of HS are
mostly represented by plant-derived biomolecules (lignins, lipids, tannins, carbohydrates, etc.). As a
result, HS show a wide spectrum of biological activity. Despite that, HS remain a ‘biological activity
black-box’ due to unknown structures of constituents responsible for the interaction with molecular
targets. In this study, we investigated the antiviral activity of eight HS fractions isolated from peat
and coal, as well as of two synthetic humic-like materials. We determined molecular compositions
of the corresponding samples using ultra-high resolution fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance
mass-spectrometry (fticR MS). inhibitory activity of HS was studied with respect to reproduction of
tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), which is a representative of Flavivirus genus, and to a panel of
enteroviruses (EVs). The samples of natural HS inhibited TBEV reproduction already at a concentration
of 1 µg/mL, but they did not inhibit reproduction of EVs. We found that the total relative intensity
of FTICR MS formulae within elemental composition range commonly attributed to flavonoid-like
structures is correlating with the activity of the samples. in order to surmise on possible active structural
components of HS, we mined formulae within FTICR MS assignments in the ChEMBL database. Out
of 6502 formulae within FTICR MS assignments, 3852 were found in ChEMBL. There were more than
71 thousand compounds related to these formulae in ChEMBL. To support chemical relevance of these
compounds to natural HS we applied the previously developed approach of selective isotopic exchange
coupled to fticR MS to obtain structural information on the individual components of HS. this enabled
to propose compounds from ChEMBL, which corroborated the labeling data. The obtained results
provide the first insight onto the possible structures, which comprise antiviral components of HS and,
respectively, can be used for further disclosure of antiviral activity mechanism of HS.
