The East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS) is the broadest and shallowest continental shelf in the World Ocean. It is characterized by both the highest rate of coastal erosion and a large volume of riverine input of terrigenous dissolved organic matter (DOM). DOM plays a significant role in marine aquatic ecosystems. The colored (chromophoric) fraction of DOM (CDOM) directly affects the quantity and spectral quality of available light, thereby impacting both primary production and UV exposure in aquatic ecosystems. A multi-year study of DOM optical parameters and the spectral characteristics of the DOM chromophoric fraction were carried out in the vast ESAS in the summer-fall seasons. The spectral characteristics of CDOM were applied to identify different biogeochemical provinces in the surveyed area. The analysis of CDOM spectral characteristics showed that the major part of the Laptev and East Siberian Sea shelf (making up the ESAS) is influenced by terrigenous DOM with high aromaticity, stemming from riverine discharge. The atmospheric circulation regime is the dominant factor controlling CDOM spatial distribution on the ESAS. A western and an eastern regime of ESAS, separated around 165-170° E, were identified with distinctly different DOM optical properties. Strong correlation between DOC and CDOM concentrations in surface shelf waters influenced by terrigenous discharge indicates feasibility of estimating DOC content from the CDOM assessed in situ using a WETStar fluorometer. The direct estimation of optical characteristics of DOM in ESAS waters provided by this study will also be useful for validation and calibration of remote sensing data.

<p>The East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS) is the broadest and shallowest continental shelf in the World Ocean. It is characterized by both the highest rate of coastal erosion and a large volume of riverine input of terrigenous dissolved organic matter (DOM). DOM plays a significant role in marine aquatic ecosystems. The colored (chromophoric) fraction of DOM (CDOM) directly affects the quantity and spectral quality of available light, thereby impacting both primary production and UV exposure in aquatic ecosystems. A multi-year study of DOM optical parameters and the spectral characteristics of the DOM chromophoric fraction were carried out in the vast ESAS in the summer-fall seasons. The spectral characteristics of CDOM were applied to identify different biogeochemical provinces in the surveyed area. The analysis of CDOM spectral characteristics showed that the major part of the Laptev and East Siberian Sea shelf (making up the ESAS) is influenced by terrigenous DOM with high aromaticity, stemming from riverine discharge.
