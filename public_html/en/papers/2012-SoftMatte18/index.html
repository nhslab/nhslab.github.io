Self assembly of natural organic materials (e.g., humic substances) onto mineral surfaces leads to formation of adlayers with physically different domains commonly described as glassy and rubbery. However, direct evidence for molecular compartments responsible for formation of these domains is still missing. Here, we developed alkoxysilanized humic probes capable of self-assembling onto hydroxylated surfaces. By using humic substances from contrasting sources (peat, water, coal) and DNA array glass slides, we show that humic adlayers were homogeneous on macroscale, but separated into domains of nanosize (rubbery) prevailing in coal and water, and submicro-size (glassy) dominating in peat, and had the roughness proportional to carbohydrate content of the adsorbate. To our knowledge, this is the first direct demonstration of the impact of molecular structures of humic adsorbate onto the adlayer morphology achieved through a use of the alkoxysilanized probes. In this fashion, the humic adlayer with molecularly-defined functional elements can be assembled onto any hydroxylated surface in situ, at water-solid interface.
