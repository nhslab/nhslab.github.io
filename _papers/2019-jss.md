# Abstract

Humic substances (HS) are viewed as an inherent component
of soil organic matter, which plays multiple life-sustaining
functions in the environment. The complexity of the molecu-
larensembleofhumicsubstancesisreflectedinsingularphys-
icochemical featuresand results inuniquely broad and diverse
interactions with both abiotic components and living organ-
isms directed towards adaptation of life to its abiotic environ-
ment. The reported examples of mediating roles of HS in soil
range from the transport of available nutrients in soil solution
(Olaetxea etal.2018) tothe remediation ofcontaminatedsoils
(Perminova and Hatfield 2005). Still, the major problem re-
mains in transferring the molecular engineering of nature into
the technology world. This problem gave rise to the topic of
the Fourth International Conference on Humic Innovative
Technologies (HIT) BFrom molecular analysis of humic
substances - to nature-like technologies,^ which was orga-
nized by the CIS chapter of the International Humic
Substances Society on October 15â€“20, 2017, in Moscow,
Russia (www.humus.ru/hit-2017). The papers presented at
that conference formed the basis for this special issue of
the Journal of Soils and Sediments.
