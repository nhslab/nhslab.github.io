# Abstract 

 Using the size-exclusion chromatography method, the molecular-mass distribution of dissolved organic matter of drinking water and water sources of Ufa is studied. The inf luence of seasonal changes and various water treatment stages on the molecular-mass distribution of dissolved organic matter is shown.
