# Abstract 

 Adsorption of the herbicide acetochlor on eleven soils of different soil-geographical zones was studied. Distribution coefficients of acetochlor, K-d and K-OC, were calculated from the isotherms obtained. It was shown that the adsorption capacity of soils for acetochlor increases with increasing content of organic carbon and the specific surface. A hydrophobic mechanism was suggested for the adsorption of acetochlor by soils.
