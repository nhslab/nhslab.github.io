# Abstract

The non-living humic systems interact instantly with the living systems and sustain environmental health. These interactions range from mediating effects of HS in the polluted ecosystems to those on microbial metabolism, plant physiology, and human health. Many of these topics were addressed at the Fifth International Conference on Humic Innovative Technologies (HIT) “Humic substances and living systems”, which was organized by the CIS chapter of the International Humic Substances Society and the Lomonosov Moscow State University (Department of Chemistry) on Oct. 19–23, 2019, in the sailing club “Vodnik”, Moscow Region, Russia (www.humus.ru/hit-2019). The papers presented at the conference (Book of Abstracts. 2019) have formed the basis for this Virtual Special Issue (VSI).
