# Abstract 

 Natural polyelectrolytes, humic substances, are suggested to control in situ growth of feroxyhyte nanoparticles of a highly reduced mean size and with enhanced colloidal stability in salt solutions. The feroxyhyte is formed as 2–5 nm thick and 20 × 20 nm wide nanoflakes due to the blocking of developing facets of feroxyhyte and constraints caused by diffusion limitations of ionic constituents across partially charged branches of humic substances.
