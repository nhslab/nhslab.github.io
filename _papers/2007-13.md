# Abstract 

 Alkoxysilylated humic derivatives were used to create covalently bound humic coatings on silica gel. The corresponding reaction was conducted in an aqueous milieu that was feasible due to the water solubility of these derivatives. The alkoxysilylated humic derivatives were obtained by alkoxysilylation of leonardite humic acid (HA) and hydroquinone-modified HA (HQ) with enhanced redox properties. The silica gel coated with covalently bound HA and HQ was tested for sequestration of aqueous Np(V) and Pu(V) under anaerobic conditions. Greater sequestration with respect to Pu(V) (up to 97\%) as compared to Np(V) (up to 60\%) was demonstrated for samples of silica gel coated with HA and HQ, whereas sorption of both actinides on pure silica gel did not exceed 20\%. Results provide bench-scale proof that alkoxysilylated humic derivatives can be used as reagents for the in situ installation of permeable reactive barriers designed to remediate actinide-contaminated groundwater.
