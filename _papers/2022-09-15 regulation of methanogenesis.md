abstract:  Combinations of various strategic approaches to the suppression of methanogenesis and the formation of biogas with a simultaneous decrease in the ratio of methane in its composition were investigated. Introduction of methanogenesis suppressors such as redox derivatives of humic acids, potassium persulfate (K2S2O8), possessing oxidizing and electron acceptor properties, enzyme hexahistidine-containing organophosphorus hydrolase with high lactonase activity and polypeptide antimicrobial agent bacitracin into the media with anaerobic consortia were studied. The effect of these substances was directed at various participants of the natural methanogenic consortium, as well as on the biochemical processes carried out by them. The use of K2S2O8 together with bacitracin provided maximum and almost complete suppression of CH4 production. The measured concentration of intracellular adenosine triphosphate has shown that viability of cells in the consortium remained almost the same, whereas their metabolic activity decreased. Various combinations of the above-mentioned suppressors provided different degrees of methanogenesis suppression, but redox agents played a key role in all the cases studied.

# Abstract

Combinations of various strategic approaches to the suppression of methanogenesis and the formation of biogas with a simultaneous decrease in the ratio of methane in its composition were investigated. Introduction of methanogenesis suppressors such as redox derivatives of humic acids, potassium persulfate (K2S2O8), possessing oxidizing and electron acceptor properties, enzyme hexahistidine-containing organophosphorus hydrolase with high lactonase activity and polypeptide antimicrobial agent bacitracin into the media with anaerobic consortia were studied. The effect of these substances was directed at various participants of the natural methanogenic consortium, as well as on the biochemical processes carried out by them. The use of K2S2O8 together with bacitracin provided maximum and almost complete suppression of CH4 production. The measured concentration of intracellular adenosine triphosphate has shown that viability of cells in the consortium remained almost the same, whereas their metabolic activity decreased. Various combinations of the above-mentioned suppressors provided different degrees of methanogenesis suppression, but redox agents played a key role in all the cases studied. Based on the accumulated data, combining suppressors in different concentrations can be used to manage the methanogenesis (efficiency and velocity of its decrease) in media with anaerobic consortia.
