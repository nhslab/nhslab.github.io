# Abstract

Nanodiamonds produced by the detonation method are used as lubricants, polishing compositions, polymer composites, etc. To reveal how nanodiamonds differ in terms of surface properties and interact with natural organic matter, we used tritium-labelled humic substances to quantitively describe their adsorption onto the nanodiamond surface. It was shown that the adsorption of humic substances onto nanodiamonds resulted in fractionation of humic substances that was strongly dependent on the zeta potential of nanodiamonds in water but did not significantly affect the uptake of nanodiamonds by wheat seedlings. The uptake of nanodiamond particles by plants was determined by the functional composition of the particle surface.
