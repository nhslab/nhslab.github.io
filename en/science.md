# Laboratory tasks

Investigation of the structure and properties of supramolecular ensembles of natural humic systems in order to create nature-like structures, materials and technologies by methods of rational design and property prediction.

## Molecular Analysis

![classification of humic substances](/assets/images/science/classification.jpg)

Molecular analysis of humic substances by ultra-high resolution magnetic resonance (Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy) and convolution of the obtained "big data" to create a chemical library of humic systems, classification and models "structure- property"

## Directed chemical modification

![modification of humic substances](/assets/images/science/modification.jpg)

Development of methods for directed modification and fractionation of humic systems aimed at obtaining humic products with desired properties, including redox activity, surface activity, introduction of biogenic or biologically active metals

## Functional properties and biological activity

Study of the functional properties and biological activity of the original and modified humic systems for the development of nature-like technologies, in particular: for the purification of contaminated media from toxicants (self-programmed injection materials), for the restoration of soil fertility ("green ameliorants"), for the delayed release of biogenic elements ("nanofertilizers ").
work on the delivery of medicines: restoration of antibiotic sensitivity (synergy with beta-lactamase inhibitors), correction of iron-deficiency anemia (complexes with delayed-release iron), creation of microbicides (means of preventing HIV infection), etc.
