#### Humic substances are all kinds of chemistry at once
Probably, each of us has wondered more than once how living matter once appeared from inanimate matter. Where is this line? What is the fundamental difference? What are the conditions for this transition? Is it possible to create them artificially? It turns out that the possibility of such a transition is carried out by humic systems that support life in all its diversity. What is it, why it is important to study them and what new opportunities it gives us, says Irina Perminova, Doctor of Chemical Sciences, Professor, Head of the Laboratory of Natural Humic Systems of the Department of Medical Chemistry and Fine Organic Synthesis of the Chemical Faculty of Moscow State University.
