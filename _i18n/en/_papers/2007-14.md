# Abstract 

 Actinides in their higher valence states (e.g., MO 2 + and MO 2 2+, where M can be Np, Pu, etc) possess a higher potential for migration and in turn pose a substantial environmental threat. To minimize this potential for migration, reducing them to lower oxidation states (e.g., their tetravalent state) can be an attractive and efficient remedial process. These lower oxidation states are often much less soluble in natural aqueous media and are, therefore, less mobile in the environment. The research presented here focuses on assessing the performance of quinonoid-enriched humic derivatives with regardsto complexing and/or reducing Np(V) present in solution. These {\dq\dq\dq
