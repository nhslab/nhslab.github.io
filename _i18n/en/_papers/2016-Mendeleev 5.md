# Abstract 

 The study applies in-depth analysis of molecular composition of humic acids extracted from leonardite and lignites by ultra-high resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass-spectrometry. The results reveal substantial differences in structural motifs of lignite and leonardite humates, which can be used for standardization and molecular systematics of humics, as well as for directed design of humate-based products.
