# Abstract


The conference “Results and prospects of development of new polyphenolic drugs for cancer patients” took place at the N.N. Petrov National Medical Research Center of Oncology (PNMRCO) on May 31, 2017, and gathered researchers involved in development and evaluation of medicinal products based on the novel lignin-derived soluble polyphenolic polymer BP-Cx-1. BP-Cx-1 is the platform for a portfolio of innovative pharmacological products such as BP-C1, BP-C2 and BP-C3.
