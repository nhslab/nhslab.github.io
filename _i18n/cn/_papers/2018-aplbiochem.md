# Abstract

Bioconversion of phenolic monomers of lignin (veratrol, vanillin, vanillin alcohol), hydrolytic lignin and sodium lignosulfonate (the product of the chemical modification of native lignin) by the basidial fungus Lentinus tigrinus was studied. The growth of fungi was suppressed in the medium containing lignin monomeric compounds. At the same time, a substantial increase in the fungal biomass was observed in the medium containing technical sodium lignosulfonate. Physical-chemical studies were conducted on the biotransformation products of sodium lignosulfonate. They showed that the main direction of bioconversion of lignosulfonate was oxidative condensation with the formation of humic-like substances. There was no depolymerization of the ligninic phenolic scaffold observed. Aromatic carbon atoms of the phenolic scaffold were not involved in the growth of fungal biomass, unlike the polysaccharides. The observed growth of the fungus on the technical sodium lignosulfonate was explained by the presence of impurities of oligomeric hemicellulose and cellulose in the starting material that can be used by the fungus as a source of carbon.
