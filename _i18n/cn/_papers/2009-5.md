# Abstract 

 A range of labeled humic substances was obtained by the tritium thermal activation method. The high specific radioactivity and radiochemical purity allowed direct determination of the hydrophobicity and surface activity of humic substances, and investigation of the behavior of humic substances in bacteria and plants.
