<p>Many natural substances exhibit anti-inflammatory activity and considerable potential in prophylaxis and treatment of allergies. Knowing exact molecular targets, which is required for developing these as medicinal products, is often challenging for multicomponent compositions.</p>

<p>In the present study we examined novel polyphenolic substance, a water-soluble fraction of wood lignin (laboratory code BP-Cx-1). In our previous study, a number of polyphenolic components of BP-Cx-1 (flavonoids, sapogenins, phenanthrenes etc.) were identified as the major carriers of biological activity of BP-Cx drug family, and several molecular targets involved in cancer and/or inflammation signaling pathways were proposed based on the results of the in vitro and in silico screening studies.</p>

<p>In the present study, half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of BP-Cx-1 was established with a radioligand method and a range of IC50 values between 22.8 and 40.3 Î¼g/ml were obtained for adenosine receptors A1, A2A and prostaglandin receptors EP2, IP (PGI2). IC50 for serotonin 5-HT1 and for glucocorticoid GR receptors were 3.0 Î¼g/ml and 12.6 Î¼g/ml, respectively, both being within the range of BP-Cx-1 concentrations achievable in in vivo models.</p>

<p>Further, distribution of [3H] labelled BP-Cx-1 in NIH3T3 murine fibroblasts and MCF7/R carcinoma cells was studied with autoradiography. [3H]-BP-Cx-1 (visualized as silver grains produced by tritium beta particles) was mainly localized along the cell membrane, in the perinuclear region and in the nucleus, suggesting ability of BP-Cx-1 to enter cells and bind to membrane or cytosol receptors.</p>

<p>In our experiment, we observed the effect of BP-Cx-1 on maturation of dendritic cells (DCs): downregulation of expression of the lipid-presentation molecule CD1a, co-stimulatory molecules CD80, CD83 and CD 40, decreased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and TNF-Î± and increased production of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. It is hypothesized that [3H]-BP-Cx-1 detectable in the nucleus is part of the activated GR complex, known to be involved in regulation of transcription of genes responsible for the anti-inflammatory response. Based on IC50, cell distribution data and results of the experiment with DCs it is suggested that the in vivo effects of BP-Cx-1 are mediated via GR and 5-HT1 receptors thus promoting development of tolerogenic effector function in dendritic cells.</p>
